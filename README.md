# 🏥 Healthcare Appointment Booking App

A responsive, frontend-only React application that enables users to:
- Browse doctors by specialization or name
- View detailed profiles
- Book appointments seamlessly

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React JS** – UI rendering
- **React Router DOM** – Page navigation
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive layout
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **JavaScript** – App logic
- **JSON** – Static doctor and appointment data

## 📂 Folder Structure

```

/public
└── doctors.json
/src
├── components/
├── pages/
├── data/
└── App.js

```

## 🧩 Features

- 🔍 **Search & Filter** doctors by name or specialization
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Doctor Profile** with bio, availability & image
- 📅 **Book Appointment** with form validation
- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 💡 Improvements with More Time

- 🔐 Add backend with secure login (JWT auth)
- 📧 Email notifications for appointment confirmation
- 📅 Google Calendar integration
- 👩‍⚕️ Doctor-side dashboard to manage availability
- 🗂 Filter by location, rating, and availability
- 🌍 Deploy on Vercel/Netlify with CI/CD pipelines

## 🧠 Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Managing state between search, profile, and appointment | Used `useState` and prop drilling to handle filtered data and selections cleanly |
| Responsiveness across all viewports | Used a hybrid of Tailwind + Bootstrap grid system and tested breakpoints manually |
| Avoiding backend for appointment persistence | Temporarily used local component state for appointment simulation |
